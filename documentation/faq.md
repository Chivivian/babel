## General

### What is Babel?
Babel is an AI-powered document translation platform that translates PDFs, Word documents, and other files while preserving the original formatting and layout.

### How is Babel different from Google Translate or DeepL?
Unlike browser-based translators that only handle plain text, Babel:
1. **Preserves document formatting** (fonts, tables, images, layouts)
2. **Outputs ready-to-use PDFs** (no manual reformatting required)
3. **Offers bilingual side-by-side output** for review
4. **Supports custom glossaries** for consistent terminology

### What file formats are supported?
- **PDF** (including scanned documents with OCR)
- **DOCX** (Microsoft Word)
- **PPTX** (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- **TXT** (Plain text)

## Pricing & Credits

### How do credits work?
Credits are the universal currency for translations. **1 Credit ≈ 10 Characters**. 

When you upload a document, we calculate the character count and show you the estimated credit cost before you confirm.

### What counts as a "character"?
Every letter, number, space, and punctuation mark counts as one character. For example:
- "Hello World" = 11 characters = ~1.1 Credits

### Can I buy more credits mid-month?
Credit Top-Ups are coming soon. For now, you can upgrade to a higher tier at any time, and the new credit balance takes effect immediately.

### Do unused credits roll over?
Currently, credits reset at the start of each billing cycle. This allows us to keep subscription prices lower.

## Translation Quality

### How accurate are the translations?
Babel uses GPT-4o and other state-of-the-art LLMs, which deliver near-human accuracy for most language pairs. Tier 1 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese) have the highest accuracy.

### Can I use my own terminology?
Yes! **Glossary Management** is available on Growth and Business plans. Upload a CSV with your source/target term pairs, and Babel will enforce them during translation.

### What if I find an error in my translation?
Contact our support team. We offer free re-translations if there are significant quality issues. Business plan customers have access to priority review queues.

## Security & Privacy

### Is my data secure?
Absolutely. Babel uses:
- **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest
- **TLS 1.3** for data in transit
- **SOC 2 Type II compliance** (Business plan)
- **Automatic data deletion** after 30 days (configurable)

### Are my documents used to train AI models?
**No.** Your documents are never used for model training. They are processed, delivered, and then deleted according to your retention settings.

### Can I request my data be deleted immediately?
Yes. You can delete any document from your dashboard at any time. Business plan customers can configure automatic deletion after every translation.
