# BabelDOC Pricing Model

## Philosophy: Fair, Transparent, & Scalable

We believe you should only pay for what you translate. Unlike traditional "per-document" limits that penalize small files or "per-seat" costs that discourage collaboration, BabelDOC uses a **Universal Credit System**.

This ensures that a startup translating 100 small reports pays the same fair price as an enterprise translating 5 massive manuals.

## How It Works

### The Credit System
Everything in BabelDOC is powered by **Credits**.

> **1 Credit ≈ 10 Characters**

This exchange rate is fixed, giving you a predictable way to accept costs.
- **Average Page**: ~2,000 Characters = **200 Credits**
- **Average Document (25 Pages)**: ~50,000 Characters = **5,000 Credits**
- **Massive Manual (500 Pages)**: ~1,000,000 Characters = **100,000 Credits**

### Usage Example
If you are on the **Starter Plan (500,000 Credits)**, you could translate:
- **10** Massive Manuals (500 pages each), OR
- **100** Average Documents (25 pages each), OR
- **2,500** Single-Page Letters.

You serve the mix that fits your business.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Credits instead of Documents?
"Document" counts are arbitrary. A 2-page memo and a 500-page legal contract are both "one document," but they have vastly different costs and values. Credits align the price with the actual work being done by the AI.

### What happens if I run out of credits?
You will be notified when you reach 80% and 100% of your usage. You can easily upgrade to the next tier or purchase a one-time "Credit Top-Up" (coming soon) to finish your month.

### Do unused credits rollover?
Currently, credits reset at the start of each billing cycle to keep our monthly subscription rates as low as possible.

## How Babel Works

Babel is a powerful AI-driven document translation platform that preserves the original formatting, layout, and structure of your files. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Upload Your Document
Simply drag and drop your PDF, DOCX, or other supported file into the Babel dashboard. Our system instantly analyzes the document structure, including:
- Text blocks and paragraphs
- Tables and charts
- Images and captions
- Headers, footers, and page numbers

### Step 2: AI-Powered Translation
Once you select your target language, Babel's AI engine (powered by advanced LLMs like GPT-4o) translates your content while:

1. **Preserving Layout**: The paragraph structure, fonts, and spacing are maintained.
2. **Handling Complex Formats**: Tables, multi-column layouts, and embedded images are kept intact.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Unlike basic word-for-word translation, our AI understands context, ensuring accurate and natural-sounding output.
4. **Glossary Support (Growth+)**: For professional use, custom terminology can be enforced to maintain brand voice or industry jargon.

> **Credit Consumption**: Credits are deducted based on the **character count** of the source document. You can see the estimated credit cost before confirming any translation.

### Step 3: Download Your Translated Document
Your translated file is ready in minutes (depending on document size). You can download:
- **Translated-Only PDF**: A clean version in your target language.
- **Bilingual PDF**: Side-by-side original and translated text for review or comparison.
