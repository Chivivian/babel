## Language Pair Recommendations

For **best results**, we recommend:
1. **English as a pivot**: When translating between two non-English languages (e.g., Japanese → Spanish), the AI often performs better via English.
2. **Glossaries for technical content**: Upload industry-specific terms to ensure accuracy.
3. **Proofreading for Tier 3**: While quality is good, a quick human review is recommended for public-facing content.
