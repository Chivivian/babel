# Legal Note

The translation and open sourcing of academic works under the Babel Translation Project is conducted in accordance with international fair use and fair dealing principles as established by the Berne Convention, U.S. Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 107), and Indian Copyright Act (Section 52), which collectively permit the creation of derivative works for non-commercial educational, research, and preservation purposes. All translations are provided with proper attribution to original authors and institutions, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0), and framed as transformative contributions that enhance global accessibility to technical knowledge—an approach consistently upheld by recent court precedents including Authors Guild v. Google (2015) and 2025 AI fair use rulings. This project operates in good faith to advance open science and education; however, this notice does not constitute legal advice, and users should consult qualified counsel for jurisdiction-specific guidance.
