**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025  
**Jurisdiction Focus:** International, US, and India

## Summary

This legal note addresses the permissibility of translating academic and technical works ("Babel Translation") and open sourcing the resulting derivatives. Based on international copyright frameworks, fair use/fair dealing doctrines, and recent court precedents (2020-2025), such activities are **generally permissible** under the following conditions:

- ✅ Non-commercial use
- ✅ Proper attribution to original authors
- ✅ Transformative enhancement (multi-language accessibility, annotations, collaborative features)
- ✅ Educational or research purpose

---

## Legal Basis

### 1. Fair Use / Fair Dealing

| Jurisdiction | Applicable Law | Key Provision |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **United States** | 17 U.S.C. § 107 | Four-factor test favoring educational, non-commercial, transformative use |
| **India** | Copyright Act, 1957 § 52 | Fair dealing for research, private study, and education |
| **International** | Berne Convention Art. 10 | Exceptions for public interest and education |

### 2. Transformative Use Doctrine

Multi-language translation repositories qualify as **transformative works** when they:
- Add new utility (accessibility for non-English speakers)
- Create collaborative, annotated resources
- Serve educational purposes beyond the original work's scope

### 3. Archiving & Preservation

When original sources become inaccessible (link rot, site changes), preservation through translation is supported by:
- US Copyright Act § 108 (library/archive exceptions)
- UNESCO Open Science Recommendation (2021)
- Indian Copyright Act § 52 (reproductions for preservation)

| Non-commercial use | 🟢 Low | Strongest fair use protection |
| Full translation (not excerpts) | 🟡 Medium | Mitigated by transformative framing |
| Commercial use | 🔴 High | Not recommended without explicit license |
